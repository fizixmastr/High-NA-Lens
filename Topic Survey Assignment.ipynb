You will be required to generate two visualization plots. The first one will be a plot to summarize the results of a survey that was conducted to gauge an audience interest in different data science topics. The second plot is a Choropleth map of the crime rate in San Francisco.\n\nPlease note that this assignment is worth 20% of your final grade."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Description of the Data\nA survey was conducted to gauge an audience interest in different data science topics, namely:\n\nBig Data (Spark / Hadoop)\nData Analysis / Statistics\nData Journalism\nData Visualization\nDeep Learning\nMachine Learning\nThe participants had three options for each topic: Very Interested, Somewhat interested, and Not interested. 2,233 respondents completed the survey.\n\nThe survey results have been saved in a csv file and can be accessed through this link: [Topic_Survey_Assignment](https://cf-courses-data.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/IBMDeveloperSkillsNetwork-DV0101EN-SkillsNetwork/labs/FinalModule_Coursera/data/Topic_Survey_Assignment.csv) (Downloaded for Posterity)"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Question 1\nIf you examine the csv file, you will find that the first column represents the data science topics and the first row represents the choices for each topic.\n\nUse the pandas read_csv method to read the csv file into a pandas dataframe, that looks like the following:\n\n\nIn order to read the data into a dataframe like the above, one way to do that is to use the index_col parameter in order to load the first column as the index of the dataframe.

Recall that 2,233 respondents completed the survey. Round percentages to 2 decimal places.\nAs for the chart:\nuse a figure size of (20, 8),\nbar width of 0.8,\nuse color #5cb85c for the Very interested bars, color #5bc0de for the Somewhat interested bars, and color #d9534f for the Not interested bars,\nuse font size 14 for the bar labels, percentages, and legend,\nuse font size 16 for the title, and,\ndisplay the percentages above the bars as shown above, and remove the left, top, and right borders.\nOnce you are satisfied with your chart, please upload a screenshot of your plot.

In this question, you are required to create a Choropleth map to visualize crime in San Francisco.\n\nBefore you are ready to start building the map, let's restructure the data so that it is in the right format for the Choropleth map. Essentially, you will need to create a dataframe that lists each neighborhood in San Francisco along with the corresponding total number of crimes(including all the 39 crime type categories).\n\nBased on the San Francisco crime dataset, you will find that San Francisco consists of 10 main neighborhoods, namely:\n\nCentral,\nSouthern,\nBayview,\nMission,\nPark,\nRichmond,\nIngleside,\nTaraval,\nNorthern, and,\nTenderloin.\nConvert the San Francisco dataset, which you can also find here, San Francisco dataset , into a pandas dataframe, like the one shown below, that represents the total number of crimes in each neighborhood.\n\nPaste  this link in the browser and download the zip file. \n\nExtract the csv file from the zip file.\n\nLater upload the csv file to skills lab and use it.\n\n\nOnce you are happy with your dataframe, upload a screenshot of your pandas dataframe.

In order to save you the hassle of looking for the right file, I already downloaded it for you and I am making it available via this link: GeoJSON\n\nFor the map, make sure that:\n\nit is centred around San Francisco,\nyou use a zoom level of 12,\nyou use fill_color = 'YlOrRd',\nyou define fill_opacity = 0.7,\nyou define line_opacity=0.2, and,\nyou define a legend and use the default threshold scale.\nIf you follow the lab on Choropleth maps and use the GeoJSON correctly, you should be able to generate the following map:\n\n\nOnce you are ready to submit your map, please upload a screenshot of your Choropleth map.
